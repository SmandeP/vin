WHAT IS NODE-X?

NODE-X unites Masternode, Proof of Stake and Mobile exchange in just one APP, masternode is a full node that keeps the full data of a blockchain in real time. Nowadays masternode coins are gaining momentum given the huge amount of rewards from it, well we are here to make masternoding easier and even get more rewards from them in just one app. Masternode application is quite flexible.  It compensates for proof of work's limitations and behaves almost like a buffed-up version proof of stake systems. While their lasting application is still speculative, masternodes have serious potential to expedite distributive consensus and further democratize decision making within blockchain communities.  If you can muster the capital, they're certainly a promising investment opportunity, as their approach to consensus and network monitoring offer a middle-of-the-road solution to the problems facing both proof of work and proof of stake models.  NODE-X is an app powered by an AI “artificial intelligence”
